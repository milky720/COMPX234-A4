This program implements a client-server file transfer system using UDP with reliability mechanisms. 
The server handles multiple clients concurrently via threads, assigning each a unique port for file transmission. 
The client requests files sequentially, using a stop-and-wait protocol with timeout and retransmission to ensure reliable delivery. 
Files are transferred in chunks, with Base64 encoding for data integrity.

How to test my networked system? ^_^
// Start the server
cd Server
python UDPserver.py 51234

// Start the client
cd Client
python UDPclient.py localhost 51234 files.txt

// MD5
Run "md5sum -b *" over the set of files and compare the hash with the files in the server.

// Start multiple clients
Open multiple terminal windows and run the client in each terminal at the same time.
cd Client
python UDPclient.py localhost 51234 files.txt
cd Client2
python UDPclient.py localhost 51234 files.txt
